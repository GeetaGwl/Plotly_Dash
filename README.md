 Introduction to Dash
Downloaded 800,000 times per month, Dash is the original low-code framework for rapidly building data apps in Python, R, Julia, and F# (experimental).

Written on top of Plotly.js and React.js, Dash is ideal for building and deploying data apps with customized user interfaces. It's particularly suited for anyone who works with data.

Through a couple of simple patterns, Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols that are required to build a full-stack web app with interactive data visualization.

Dash is simple enough that you can bind a user interface to your code in less than 10 minutes.
